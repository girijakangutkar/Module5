        Set within a year after the events of Batman Begins (2005), Batman,
        Lieutenant James Gordon, and new District Attorney Harvey Dent
        successfully begin to round up the criminals that plague Gotham City,
        until a mysterious and sadistic criminal mastermind known only as "The
        Joker" appears in Gotham, creating a new wave of chaos. Batman's
        struggle against The Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to
        "confront everything he believes" and improve his technology to stop
        him. A love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent, and Rachel
        Dawes.—Leon Lombardi

        Despite his tarnished reputation after the events of The Dark Knight
        (2008), in which he took the rap for Dent's crimes, Batman feels
        compelled to intervene to assist the city and its Police force, which is
        struggling to cope with Bane's plans to destroy the city.—WellardRockard

        Two years of nights have turned Bruce Wayne into a nocturnal animal. But
        as he continues to find his way as Gotham's dark knight Bruce is forced
        into a game of cat and mouse with his biggest threat so far, a manic
        killer known as "The Riddler" who is filled with rage and determined to
        expose the corrupt system whilst picking off all of Gotham's key
        political figures. Working with both established and new allies, Bruce
        must track down the killer and see him brought to justice, while
        investigating his father's true legacy and questioning the effect that
        he has had on Gotham so far as "The Batman."—jc-15610
